# Context

In this module we have 2 contexts:
    1. **EnrolledModalState**: This context is used to manage the state of the enrolled modal. It contains the `useDisclosure` hook to manage the modal's open and close state.
    2. **SelectedQuiz**: This context is for managing the state of the selected quiz.
